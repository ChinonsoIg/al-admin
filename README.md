## Description
This is the Admin Dashboard for the AlmightyGains website.

## Download and Installation

## Usage

After installation, run `npm install` to install the node_modules. Then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the site in your default browser. Live reload is enabled when changes to the file are saved.

### Gulp Tasks

* `gulp` the default task that builds everything
* `gulp watch` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
